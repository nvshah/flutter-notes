* Immutable Abstract Class :
  ---
   -> If you have an immmutable abstract class, then add a constant empty constructor to it.
      So your subclasses can also be immutable with const constructor


* String Data inn Dart :
  ----
   -> Uint8List.fromList(codeUnits)

* Function Pointer in Flutter :
  -----
   -> typedef

   -> allow you to reuse your code by passing pointer to function to another function 
     (ie First class Citizens | High Order Functions)
      


----------
(Advanced Flutter Tips)

* LazyStream :
  ---
   -> use #LazyStream if the code that leads upto creation of your #Stream is doing heavy computation.
      This will ensure that creation of your Stream 
      won't take up Computation time if the Stream isn't `listened to`


2) consolidateHttpClientResponseBytes :
   ------
    -> It allows you to effectively grab the Uint8List data out of the URL by sending a Get request to it.
       You dont have to transform data anymore

* Streams & Drains :
  ----
   notion :- If you just want to know if your stream finishes successfully or not
            you can use .drain() on stream's instance

   -> it will return Future<T>, where T is obj you provide in drain(t),
      if ran success otherwise it will return error packed in Future
