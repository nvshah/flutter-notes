* Widget :
  ----
   - Blueprint or Recipie about What UI should look like 

* Element :
  ----
   - Holds info abt where widget stays in relative to other widgets in Widget Tree
   - It just implements BuildContext 
    
   - Context :- Some Meta-Information
       \
        - Info such as {Parent, Child, }

   - Elements references to the widgets
     & are responsible for comparing the Widget differences

   If widget is responsible for creting child widgets
   then elements is created for each child object

   => BuildContext obj are Element obj actually
   

* RenderObject :
  -----
   -> Beyond the Widgets Layer there is Rennder Layer 
   -> So Widget Tree uses Render Tree underhood via Element Tree

   - Render tree- low level protocol
       \
       Render holds responsibilities such as paint protocols

   - RenderObjects :- deal with layout | Painting | Hit Testing | Accessibility
        \
         -> Everything you see on Screen is "RenderObject"
            Everything You code is "Widgets"

            Both Widget & RenderObjects are managed by Element(ie Context)

        Eg RenderBox :- 
             - 2d Coordinates Render Objects
             - Most flutter objects are RenderBox 

   -> RenderObjects can sync from frame to frame 
   -> RenderObject can be Re-Used which helps to improve Performances

   - If widget is removed from tree, then corresponding element is detached & so as corresp RenderObject

   [Keys - Significance]
    -> Flutter uses Keys to recognize if any obj move to new location so that it can utilize the same obj 

   -> If you wannt to move widget to completetly diff part of Entire Tree - then you need {Global Key}


--------
Widget Tree :- Widget's Configurations
  - Widget requests the Element to mount this things on Tree

  StatelessWidget

Element Tree :- Widget Mounted/Rendered on the Screen
  - Mounts add the elements to the element tree

  StatelessElement, StatefulElement

  -> StatefulElelement calls the corresp Widgets build method to check for child or children
     so that they can also create corresp element in Widget Tree

  StatefulWidget <- For StatefulElement -> state-obj (STATE)

  This state_obj also keeps reference to StatefulWidget
