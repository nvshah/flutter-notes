1) Keep your build() method inside statelesswidget away from side-effects.
   {i.e convert to stful & lift all heavy logic inside initState()
            - utilise didUpdateWidget() if require
    }

* There are 4 types of Chips :
   
   InputChip
   ChoiceChip
   FilterChip 
   ActionChip\

=> Create manager objects to manage functions and state changes in one place.

=> Most Flutter apps start with WidgetsApp as the root widget.

[State Management]

* FutureBuilder + HooksBuilder + ValueNotifier :
  -----------
   -> When you want to make or rebuild Your FutureBuilder widget in ahead of time for some other Future 
      You can use 
      ValueNotifier & ValueListenable that will hold val of type -> Future 
       &
       whenever we need inn future to update val just change underlying val of ValueNotifier 
       &
       use ValueListenable near to FutureBuilder Widget to rebuild only needed portion in UI


* Observe User Navigation :
  ----------
   -> RouteObserver  


-------

* StreamBuilder :
  ----
   -> Always use initialzed stream instance whilst using StreamBuilder & 
      dont call stream everytime re-building widget
