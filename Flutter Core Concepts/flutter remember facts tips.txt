flutter remember facts tips

* runApp()
  ---
  - The runApp() takes the given widget & makes it as a Root of the Widget Tree

  - It inflate given widget & attach it to screen

  Calling runApp() again will detach the previous root widget from the screen
  & attach the given widget in its place
  The new widget tree is compared to previous widget tree & any differences are applied to underlying render tree,
  Similar to what happens when stateful widget rebuilds after calling setState()


* Flutter & Native Code (Android, IOS)
  -> When you pass data from dart -> (Java, kotlin, swift, ...) its automatically decoded at the reciever side
     (ie via Codec)
     & When some response is send by Native to flutter, again response is automatically decoded back to native
     dart type


* Flutter packages (modularization)
  --------------------------
  2 options :-
    1. Git &
    2. Keep in same Repo in same project folder

    For best developer experience keep packages in same repo,
    because
    via Git: flutter often cache the packages so we may not get latest changes on pub get !

  Flutter Package & Application Project
  ---
  NOTE
  Inorder to access for Flutter Application Package/Project, you don't need to pass the package name prefix
  to asset path
  But
  Incase of flutter package, you need to provide the package name prefix or param inorder to access
  the asset at that location (inorder to use same asset in that flutter package)

  A1. package/<packageName>/<assetPath>   // Eg package/fpack/assets/img/img1.png
  A2. provide package name as param to AssetImage(assetPath, package: pkgName)
