=> You can use IntrinsicWidth | IntrinsiceHeight to get height | width take by widget
   Computationally

=> int.clamp()  // used to normalize number betweeb a to b


* Dimensions & Constraints :
  ---
  Child will not get always what dimension it defines. It depends on Parent
  & Under certain circumstance when child want more dimension & Parent doesnt allow
  Then Overflow will happen

  Otherwise Child will automatically tries to fit in the dimension provides by the Parent


* Flutter TextField Controller :
  -----
  text & selection

  selection : TextSelection
    \
     -> It decides how many positions or characters to consider while selecting this particular character or position

     Because Emojis & other other requires more unicode characters to form a single visibly symbol

* SingleChildScrollView :
  ----
  - SingleChildScrollView will do by default Shrink Wrap (Thus it is expensive compare to ListView)


* FittedBox & LayoutBuilder :
  ----
  ref : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61316414/how-to-get-inside-a-widget-the-resulting-size-of-itself-shrinked-by-fittedbox
-
  - FittedBox doesnt passess the constraints down to its child (ie infinite constraints are passed)

    Thus if there is child such as LayoutBuilder which work based on Constraints recieved from
    parent then it will get unbounded constraints

  - FittedBox passess infinite bounds to its children
