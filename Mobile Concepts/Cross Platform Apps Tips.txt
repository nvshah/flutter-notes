Q) Difference between Responsive & Adaptive(Platform) :
  ------------
   -> If you are building Cross-Platform app then it comes to Responsive (because there are multiple
      platforms like Web, Mobile, Desktop) first & then Adaption

   -> But if you consider Single Platform but different OS, (ie Android, IOS) then you may check
      for Platform Specific Widgets


   So Responsive is Parent which can comprise of Adaptiveness to platform as one of its Sub-Task or feature


3 Orientation & MediaQuery :
  -------------
  -> Potrait & Landscape

   - MediaQuery.of(context).orientation
   - OrientationBuilder()

   Shortest Side :- MediaQuery.of(context).size.shortestSide

   Principle :
     Mobile Device :- SideBar as a Drawer menu
     Tablet/Desktop :- Sidebar as a Included View in GridView/ListView/Column/Row on Left
