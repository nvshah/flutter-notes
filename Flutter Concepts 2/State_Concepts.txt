  Q) How you can achieve State management via ChangeNotifier() only (ie without Provider) ??
     ->
      You can do so by adding listenet to ChangeNotifier in initState of your StatefulWidget
      \
       changeNotifierObj.addListener(() {})


TIP :- always check mounted status (before updating/refreshing the state)
