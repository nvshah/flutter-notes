- Decoding Flutter

* PrimaryScrollController :
  ----
   - boolean parameter `primary` on

   -> Each Route Widget has a primaryScrollController wrapped around its SubTree !
      Which is an Inheroted Widget that allows
      Thus
      PrimaryScrollController.of(context)

   -> So Your ListView can subscribe to PrimaryScrollController of current Route
      Now
      Appbar of same Route can tell PrimaryScrollController about touch event
      & then ListView can listen this from controller present at top of route

   Error frol=m flutter ->
   `The ScrollController is attached to multiple ScrollView`
     \
      -> When more than 1 ScrollView are attached to same Inherited PrimaryScrollController

   -> This intersects with flutter focus system
       - Whatever Scrollable View get Focus, then regardless of primary=true or false
         Events like page+up & page+down will cause that Focussed widget to scroll

    Priority
    1. Focused Scrollable Widget (ie focused=true)
    2. Primary Scrollable Widget (ie primary=true)
