* Steps for Conditional Platform based Impl : (External Dependency)
-----------------------------------------------
ref : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58710226/how-to-import-platform-specific-dependency-in-flutter-dart-combine-web-with-an

=> Concept : ADAPTER PATTERN

This is based on the implementations from http package as in here.

The core idea is as follows.

    1. Create an abstract class to define the methods you will need to use.
    2. Create implementations specific to web and android dependencies which extends this abstract class.
    3. Create a stub which exposes a method to return the instance of this abstract implementation. This is only to keep the dart analysis tool happy.
    4. In the abstract class import this stub file along with the conditional imports specific for mobile and web. Then in its factory constructor return the instance of the specific implementation.
       This will be handled automatically by conditional import if written correctly.


Steps

1) Define abstract class (ie Interface | Contract ) for behaviour with factory to provide impl

2) Define Different impl for Diff platforms in diff files with platform specific dependencies
   (by dependencies I meant :- package, plugin, multi-modular package, etc ...)

3) Also Create a Stub File (for Genralized) purpose in case impl is not possible for other platforms than
   specific one (which are implemented in Step 2)

4) Then you can do use Conditional Import in abstract class or its impl
   & then expose this wherever you want to use in the entire project


Structure Files

- my_plugin_io.dart
- my_plugin_web.dart
- my_plugin_stub.dart
- my_plugin.dart


* Federated Plugins :
  ---------------
  -> # Cross Platform Apps
  -> Will compile in Cross-platform apps even if the plugin is meant rationally for specific platform support
     & not all

     For Eg
       if Federated Plugin is meant for Web only
       then in your Cross-platform Flutter project, You can use this way

       if(kIsWeb)  -> to only use this in case when its Web App of this Flutter project !

  => Federated plugins purpose only is that App can compile for Android/Ios even if that plugin
     is meant for Web only !
