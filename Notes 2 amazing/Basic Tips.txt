- Flutter maintains three trees in parallel: 
  the Widget, Element and RenderObject trees.

- Asynchronous code should always check if the mounted property is true before calling setstate(), 
  because the widget may no longer be part of the widget tree.

- The rule of thumb for dispose() is to check any properties 
  you define in your state and make sure you’ve disposed of them properly.

- By adding an inherited widget in your tree, you can reference the data from any of its descendants. 
  This is known as `lifting state up`.

* runApp vs main() ??
  -> main is the entry point 
  -> runApp() is the where MaterialApp is returned (ie Widget Tree root Element is instantiated)


* GLobal Variables | Eager vs Lazy | RiverPod :
  ------
   -> Global variables are always lazy-loaded. This is a specificity of how Dart behaves.


* StatefulWidget & Immutable :
  --------
  Any Widget that is StatfulWidget needs to be Immutable because parent of StatefulWidget is Immutable
  &
  But the State Widget can be immutable
